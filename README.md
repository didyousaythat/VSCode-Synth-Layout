# VSCode-Synth-Layout
Some of my settings to make a the most stylish inefficient background for coding in VScode

This repository has the custom CSS files that I used to give my coding environment that synthwave flair.

Above are the extentions used for the layout. They can all be installed via VSCode's extention marketplace. The files uploaded are the custom css files that are used in tandum with the themes to complete the layout. You're absolutely going to need custom css to get any of the text to display correctly and custom background to enable the custom backgrounds. The Custom CS file is what you will use to enable the moving background in your settings.json. If you have the extention activated, just copy and paste the code into the json file. for everything else just follow the directions given in the custom CSS extention. You don't need both the synthwave and synthwave x fluoromachine, just whichever you prefer.
